### Networking concepts
A cloud environment fundamentally changes the ways that networking is provided and consumed. Understanding the following concepts and decisions is imperative when making architectural decisions. For detailed information on networking concepts, see the OpenStack Networking Guide.

#### Network zones
The cloud networks are divided into a number of logical zones that support the network traffic flow requirements.
We recommend defining at the least four distinct network zones:
##### Underlay
    The underlay zone is defined as the physical network switching infrastructure that connects the storage, compute and control platforms. There are a large number of potential underlay options available.
##### Overlay
    The overlay zone is defined as any L3 connectivity between the cloud components and could take the form of SDN solutions such as the neutron overlay solution or 3rd Party SDN solutions.
##### Edge
    The edge zone is where network traffic transitions from the cloud overlay or SDN networks into the traditional network environments.
##### External
    The external network is defined as the configuration and components that are required to provide access to cloud resources and workloads, the external network is defined as all the components outside of the cloud edge gateways.

#### Traffic flow
There are two primary types of traffic flow within a cloud infrastructure, the choice of networking technologies is influenced by the expected loads.

- East/West
    The internal traffic flow between workload within the cloud as well as the traffic flow between the compute nodes and storage nodes falls into the East/West category. Generally this is the heaviest traffic flow and due to the need to cater for storage access needs to cater for a minimum of hops and low latency.

- North/South
    The flow of traffic between the workload and all external networks, including clients and remote services. This traffic flow is highly dependant on the workload within the cloud and the type of network services being offered.

#### Layer networking choices
There are several factors to take into consideration when deciding on whether to use Layer 2 networking architecture or a layer 3 networking architecture.
