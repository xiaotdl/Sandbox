## Install Terraform
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

After downloading Terraform, unzip the package. Terraform runs as a single binary named terraform. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Terraform will still function.

### Verifying the installation
```
$ terraform
Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] <command> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The most common, useful commands are shown first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands. If you're just getting
started with Terraform, stick with the common commands. For the
other commands, please read the help and docs before usage.

Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
    console            Interactive console for Terraform interpolations
# ...
```


## Build Infrastructure
We'll build infrastructure on AWS for the getting started guide since it is popular and generally understood.

### Configuration
The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is simply known as a _Terraform configuration_.
We're going to write our first configuration now to launch _a single AWS EC2 instance_.

The format of the configuration files is [documented here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html).
Configuration files can also be JSON, but we recommend only using JSON when the configuration is generated by a machine.

example.tf
```
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
