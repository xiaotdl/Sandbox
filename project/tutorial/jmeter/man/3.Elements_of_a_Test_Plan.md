= 3. Elements of a Test Plan =

A minimal test will consist of:
- a Test Plan,
- a Thread Group
- one or more Samplers.

== 3.0 Test Plan ==

== 3.1 Thread Group ==
Thread group elements are the beginning points of any test plan.
All controllers and samplers must be under a thread group.
Other elements, e.g. Listeners, may be placed directly under the test plan, in which case they will apply to all the thread groups.

**ThreadGroup**
- Set the number of threads
- Set the ramp-up period
- Set the number of times to execute the test

Thread Group also provides a scheduler.
You configure Duration (seconds) and Startup Delay (seconds) to control the duration of each thread group.
Alternatively, you can also use Start time and End time.

== 3.2 Controllers ==
JMeter has two types of Controllers:
- Samplers
- Logical Controllers.

**Samplers** tell JMeter to send requests to a server.
    For example, add an HTTP Request Sampler if you want JMeter to send an HTTP request. You can also customize a request by adding one or more Configuration Elements to a Sampler.
**Logical Controllers** let you customize the logic that JMeter uses to decide when to send requests.
    For example, you can add an Interleave Logic Controller to alternate between two HTTP Request Samplers.

=== 3.2.1 Samplers ===
Each sampler has several properties you can set. You can further customize a sampler by adding one or more **Configuration** Elements to the Test Plan.
refer to examples for jmx file construction:
http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html
http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#HTTP_Request

=== 3.2.2 Logic Controllers ===
test tree:
- Test Plan
    - Thread Group
        - Once Only Controller
            - Login Request (an HTTP Request)
        - Load Search Page (HTTP Sampler)
        - Interleave Controller
            - Search "A" (HTTP Sampler)
            - Search "B" (HTTP Sampler)
            - HTTP default request (Configuration Element)
        - HTTP default request (Configuration Element)
        - Cookie Manager (Configuration Element)

=== 3.2.3 Test Fragments ===
This element is purely for code re-use within Test Plans

== 3.3 Listeners ==
Listeners provide access to the information JMeter gathers about the test cases while JMeter runs.
The **Graph Results** listener plots the response times on a graph.

== 3.4 Timers ==
By default, a JMeter thread executes samplers in sequence without pausing.
We recommend that you specify a delay by adding one of the available **timers** to your **Thread Group**. If you do not add a delay, JMeter could overwhelm your server by making too many requests in a very short amount of time.
A **timer** will cause JMeter to delay a certain amount of time before each sampler which is in its scope.

== 3.5 Assertions ==
Assertions allow you to assert facts about responses received from the server being tested.
Using an assertion, you can essentially "test" that your application is returning the results you expect it to.

== 3.6 Configuration Elements ==
usage: A configuration element works closely with a **Sampler**.
       Although it does not send requests (except for HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder), it can add to or modify requests.
scope: A configuration element is accessible from only inside the tree branch where you place the element.
overwrite: a configuration element inside a tree branch has higher precedence than the same element in a "parent" branch.

== 3.7 Pre-Processor Elements ==
usage: A Pre-Processor executes some action **prior to a Sampler Request** being made.
       A Pre-Processor is most often used to modify the settings of a Sample Request just before it runs,
       or to update variables that aren't extracted from response text.

== 3.8 Post-Processor Elements ==
usage: A Post-Processor executes some action **after a Sampler Request** has been made.
       A Post-Processor is most often used to process the response data, often to extract values from it.

== 3.9 Execution order ==
0. Configuration elements
1. Pre-Processors
2. Timers
3. Sampler
4. Post-Processors (unless SampleResult is null)
5. Assertions (unless SampleResult is null)
6. Listeners (unless SampleResult is null)

== 3.10 Scoping Rules ==
The JMeter test tree contains elements that are both hierarchical and ordered.

== 3.11 Properties and Variables ==
JMeter properties are defined in jmeter.properties (see Getting Started - Configuring JMeter for more details).
Properties are global to jmeter, and are mostly used to define some of the defaults JMeter uses.
Both variables and properties are case-sensitive.

== 3.12 Using Variables to parameterise tests ==
