Table 4-3. File permissions settings, numerical values, and their meanings
Setting       Numerical    Meaning
-rw-------    (600)        Only the owner has read and write permissions.
-rw-r--r--    (644)        Only the owner has read and write permissions; the group and others have read only.
-rwx------    (700)        Only the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
-rwxr-xr-x    (755)        The owner has read, write, and execute permissions; the group and others have only read and execute.
-rwx--x--x    (711)        The owner has read, write, and execute permissions; the group and others have only execute.
-rw-rw-rw-    (666)        Everyone can read and write to the file. (Be careful with these permissions.)
-rwxrwxrwx    (777)        Everyone can read, write, and execute. (Again, this permissions setting can be hazardous.)
