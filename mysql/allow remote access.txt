1. grant remote access to user xili from host % (anywhere)
$ mysql -u<username> -p<pwd>
mysql> use mysql;
mysql> CREATE user ‘xili’@‘%’ IDENTIFIED by ‘my-pwd’;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'xili’@‘%’ WITH GRANT OPTION;

2. check current users
mysql> SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

3. comment/remove these lines
$ sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
# bind-address: IP address you want to connect to.
# skip-networking: Don’t listen for TCP/IP connections at all. All interaction with mysqld must be made via Unix sockets. This option is highly recommended for systems where only local requests are allowed.

sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
